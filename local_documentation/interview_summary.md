I need to change the analyses we're going to do - here are the questions I want to answer and I need the pages to correspon to how we 

Tab 1. Funnel rations
        a.Hypothese: for certain departments there is a steep dropoff from the ONsite to offer stage.  

        What to dhow:  Funnel ratios (with counts) filterable by department.  We also want to show the number of interviews at each stage, or something to show that we are putting a lot of interviewing hours into each candidate


Tab 2. There are things we could screen for at the pre-Onsite stage that would increase the cdhances that people would pass the Onsite stage
        a. According to feedback, why are people failing or not getting hire recommendaitons at the onsite stage?  Do the candidates have something in common(source, somthing in their profile) ?  Are there common themes in the feedback?
        b. What would we sceen for to look at at the Screen stage that would increase hires at the  

        Rubric Heatmap: A visual correlation matrix showing which skills (Technical, Design, Comms, Values) are actually driving our hiring decisions.

Tab 3:  Do we have a false negative problem
        a.  What is the evidence that there is a false negative provlem at the the onsite stage?
         
         Include The "False Negative" Detective: A prioritized list of "Archived" candidates who had high technical scores but were rejected due to a single low vote. Action: Recruiter review for potential reconsideration.

Tab 4:  Do we have an interviewer calibration Problem
        Are there people who always say no?  Are there uncalibrated interviewers?  Are some people always offering the same reason for rejections?  Are there especially influential interviewers? 

        Interviewer Calibration Leaderboard: A view identifying outliers (Hawks/Doves) who need coaching to align with the company bar.



Tab 5:  Do we have a false positive problem
        a(This will require some employees taht we have in a csv) Are there people that passed and left the company.  List of people who passed, summary of their Onsite interview feedback (descriptive hire decisions and theme feedback for each.


Tab 6: Recommendations and next steps (this will mostly be a text thing)
    a. Recommendations (will edit these) 
    - Implement additional screens at the technical screen stage to test for cultural fit - be more discerning who gets to onsigtte
    - At the onsite stage, everyone is interviewing for culture.  Focus what each person is assessing to get a better signal
    b. Stuff to follow up on
     - What happened to people we said no to - is there evidence they would have been good hires
