# **Strategic Compensation Analysis: Scaling Cursor from 200 to 1,000**

**Prepared For:** President, Cursor

**Role:** Recruiting Operations & Strategy Analysis

**Context:** Hypergrowth Phase ($29B Valuation), Opening London Hub, Unique "Working Interview" Culture.

## **1\. Executive Summary**

Cursor is currently operating with a **95%+ Offer Acceptance Rate**. While this signals a strong employer brand and effective closing process, statistically, it indicates **Compensation Inefficiency**. We are likely paying a "Certainty Premium"—bidding significantly above the market-clearing price to secure candidates who would have accepted for less.

To scale from 200 to 1,000 employees effectively, we must shift from **"Winning at all costs"** to **"Winning efficiently."**

## **2\. Core Hypotheses & Proposed Analyses**

### **A. The "Efficiency Frontier" Analysis (The $80M Opportunity)**

* **Key Question:** Are we overpaying for a 95% win rate when a 90% win rate would save millions?  
* **Hypothesis:** Reducing average equity grants by 10% will only reduce offer acceptance rates by \~5% (from 95% to 90%).  
* **The Math:** 800 hires $\\times$ $100k savings \= **$80M** in dilution savings.  
* **What "Good" Looks Like:** We find the "elbow" of the demand curve—paying just enough to win the talent we *need*.  
* **What "Bad" Looks Like:** The curve is flat (inelastic). This implies we could drop offers by $50k and lose zero candidates, meaning we have been burning cash for no reason.

### **B. The Market Competitiveness "Heat Map" (External Equity)**

* **Key Question:** Is our compensation strategy applied consistently, or are there "pocket of poverty" and "pockets of excess"?  
* **The Analysis:** Calculate **Compa-Ratio** (Salary / Market P75) for every employee.  
* **The Output:** A visual heat map colored by Department and Level. Green \= At Market, Red \= Below Market (Risk), Blue \= Above Market (Waste).  
* **What "Good" Looks Like:** Intentional differentiation. E.g., Engineering is uniformly at P90 (Strategic), while Ops is at P50 (Market).  
* **What "Bad" Looks Like:** Random hotspots. E.g., Junior Sales reps are paid at P90 while Staff Engineers are at P40, indicating a lack of centralized controls.

### **C. The Compression & Inversion Check (Internal Equity)**

* **Key Question:** Are we punishing loyalty by paying new hires more than high-performing incumbents?  
* **The Analysis:** Scatter plot of **Tenure vs. Total Cash**.  
* **The Insight:** Identify specific "Inversion Zones" where we must issue spot bonuses or equity top-ups before offer letters go out.  
* **What "Good" Looks Like:** A positive correlation line (up and to the right). Tenure \+ Performance \= Higher Pay.  
* **What "Bad" Looks Like:** A negative correlation (down and to the right). New hires earn more than veterans, creating a perverse incentive for top talent to "Quit and Re-apply."

### **D. The "Wild West" Leveling Audit**

* **Key Question:** Does our title structure support scalable growth, or is it just title inflation?  
* **The Analysis:** Histogram of headcount by Level distribution.  
* **The Goal:** Ensure our "Senior" bar remains high as we scale.  
* **What "Good" Looks Like:** A healthy pyramid or diamond shape (Entry \-\> Senior \-\> Staff).  
* **What "Bad" Looks Like:** An "Inverted Pyramid" (45 Seniors and 2 Juniors). This destroys promotion paths for the next 800 hires and inflates payroll costs.

### **E. The Equity "Cliff & Burn" Forecast**

* **Key Question:** Do we have enough equity runway to execute the 18-month hiring plan without an emergency reload?  
* **The Analysis:** Project equity burn based on current grant guidelines vs. the available pool.  
* **The Output:** A "Runway Chart" showing exactly when we run out of options (e.g., "Month 14").  
* **What "Good" Looks Like:** Runway \> 24 months, with clear buffers for refreshers and promotion grants.  
* **What "Bad" Looks Like:** Runway \< 12 months. This forces an emergency board resolution or dilution event mid-hiring spree, which kills momentum.

### **F. Offer Acceptance & Win/Loss Analysis**

* **Key Question:** Is our value proposition failing on specific dimensions (Cash vs. Equity vs. Mission)?  
* **The Analysis:** Bar chart of **Rejection Reasons** (Comp, Equity, Location, Stability).  
* **The Action:** If we lose people to OpenAI on Equity, we increase grants. If we lose on Cash, we increase salary. Don't mix them up.  
* **What "Good" Looks Like:** Losses are isolated to "Competitor offers irrationally high compensation" (which we shouldn't match).  
* **What "Bad" Looks Like:** We lose candidates on "Culture" or "Process" (things we can fix for free) or we lose on "Base Salary" while trying to compensate with "Equity."

### **G. The "Interviewer Burnout" Capacity Model**

* **Key Question:** Does our "2-day co-working" process mathematically break at 1,000 employees?  
* **The Insight:** Hiring 800 people requires **1,800 Engineering Days**. We need a pre-screen filter to save capacity.  
* **What "Good" Looks Like:** High pass-through rates at the onsite stage. We only bring in candidates who are 80% likely to pass, optimizing engineering time.  
* **What "Bad" Looks Like:** Low onsite pass rates (\<30%). We are burning 100+ hours of engineering time for every single hire, effectively halting product development.

### **H. The "Golden Handcuff" Audit**

* **Key Question:** Are our best early engineers financially incentivized to stay, or are they "vesting in peace"?  
* **The Action:** Targeted refreshers only for those whose unvested value \< market rate.  
* **What "Good" Looks Like:** Top performers have significant unvested holding power ("Golden Handcuffs").  
* **What "Bad" Looks Like:** Top performers have \<$100k unvested remaining or are fully vested, making them easy targets for poaching by competitors offering fresh grants.

## **3\. Implementation Plan**

1. **Data Unification:** Merge ATS, Pave, and Carta data.  
2. **The "Win-Rate" Scatter Plot:** Prove we are overpaying.  
3. **The "Burnout" Forecast:** Prove the interview process breaks at scale.  
4. **The Dashboard:** Deliver the "Hiring Intelligence Product" (Streamlit App).
